# anti keystroke deanonymization tool #

An event-level online anonymization kernel for input devices

A privacy tool that makes keystroke and mouse biometrics less effective. For
keyboards, this is accomplished by obfuscating the time intervals between
input events. For mice, this is done by obfuscating the time intervals between
between mouse input events, the number of mouse input events, and the exact
path taken by the mouse pointer. This data can be used for identification if
not obfuscated.

kloak is designed for use on Wayland only.
